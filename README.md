Classification of Brain Tumor Images Using CNN and Pre-trained Networks
Overview
This project presents an automated brain tumor detection system implemented in MATLAB using deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to segment and classify brain tumors from MRI images accurately by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with various optimization algorithms.

Abstract
In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is designed to segment and classify tumors from MRI images, with its training process enhanced by three optimization algorithms:

ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

SGDM (Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum)

RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)

The system evaluates the impact of these optimizers on model training dynamics while maintaining focus on accurate tumor localization and classification. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for medical image analysis, offering a framework for future advancements in AI-driven diagnostic tools.
